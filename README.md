ProjectEuler
============

A collection of my Project Euler solutions in Java

#DISCLAIMER
I orginally started Euler for myself, not originally intending to put it up for the world to see.
I recently decided to post some of my programs, they aren't any spectacular piece of work, but
they may contain some usages of classes that people might like an example of, and some solutions may
even be clever.

If you are doing Euler, I encourage you to try to find the solution yourself first, but I can understand
that it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when you've been stuck on the code for a few days.
Feel free to use my code to help, or if you've already done a solution, I may have done it differently.
It can be nice to see different solutions for the same problem.

As a final note, they are (as it should be clear already), free to use under the Apache v2 liscence.
